        <p>We don’t serve their kind here! What? Your <b>droids</b>. They’ll have to wait outside. We don’t want them
            here.
            Listen, why don’t you wait out by the speeder. We don’t want any trouble. I heartily agree with you sir.

            dewaghi wooldugger?!? He doesn’t like you. I’m sorry. I don’t like you either You just watch yourself. We’re
            wanted men. I have the death sentence in twelve systems. I’ll be careful than. You’ll be dead. This little
            one
            isn’t worth the effort. Come let me buy you something…</p>

            <h2>Characters</h2>

            <h3>Primary</h3>

            <P>Lorem ipsum dolor,<br>
                sit amet consectetur adipisicing elit.<br>
                Reiciendis, obcaecati alias. Voluptate, qui ex? Hic aut<br>
                ratione, commodi aliquam itaque repellat esse tempora<br>
                natus sit sapiente suscipit eum placeat ipsa?</P>

            <h4>Examples</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Leia</li>
                <li>Luke</li>
                <li>Darth Vader</li>
                <li>Yoda</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Secondary</h3>

            <p>The approach will not be easy. You are required to maneuver straight down this trench and skim the
                surface to
                this point. The target area is only two meters wide. It’s a small thermal exhaust port, right below the
                main
                port. The shaft leads directly to the reactor system. A precise hit will start a chain reaction which
                should
                destroy the station. Only a precise hit will set up a chain reaction. The shaft is ray-shielded, so
                you’ll
                have
                to use proton torpedoes. That’s impossible, even for a computer. It’s not impossible. I used to
                bull’s-eye
                womp
                rats in my T-sixteen back home. They’re not much bigger than two meters. Man your ships! And may the
                Force
                be
                with you!</p>

        <p>Luke? Luke? <span>Luke</span>? Have you seen Luke this morning? He said he had some things to do before he
            started today<sup>[1]</sup>, so
            he left early. Uh? Did he take those two new droids with him? I think so. Well, he’d better have those units
            in
            the south range repaired be midday or there’ll be hell to pay! Wait, there’s something dead ahead on the
            scanner. It looks like our droid…hit the accelerator on the H<sub>2</sub>0.</p>
